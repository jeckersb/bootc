# NAME

bootc-rollback - Change the bootloader entry ordering

# SYNOPSIS

**bootc rollback** \[*OPTIONS...*\]

# DESCRIPTION

Change the bootloader entry ordering; the deployment under `rollback` will be queued for the next boot,
and the current will become rollback. If there is a `staged` entry (an unapplied, queued upgrade)
then it will be discarded.

Note that absent any additional control logic, if there is an active agent doing automated upgrades
(such as the default `bootc-fetch-apply-updates.timer` and associated `.service`) the
change here may be reverted. It's recommended to only use this in concert with an agent that
is in active control.

A systemd journal message will be logged with `MESSAGE_ID=26f3b1eb24464d12aa5e7b544a6b5468` in
order to detect a rollback invocation.

## Note on Rollbacks and the `/etc` Directory

When you perform a rollback (e.g., with `bootc rollback`), any
changes made to files in the `/etc` directory won't carry over
to the rolled-back deployment. The `/etc` files will revert
to their state from that previous deployment instead.

This is because `bootc rollback` just reorders the existing
deployments. It doesn't create new deployments. The `/etc`
merges happen when new deployments are created.
